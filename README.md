## Machine Learning- Finalproject:
This project is concentrated on Olist data from multiple marketplaces in Brazil, from 2016 to 2018. 
The three goals of this project are: 
1) the relationship between location and delivery
2) discover which product category is the best-selling
3) explore how sales management affects sales performance. 

Applied the variety techniques to the dataset such as unsupervised methods (e.g., **PCA**), supervised methods (e.g.,
**classification and regression**), ensemble methods (e.g., **Random Forest Classifier and AdaBoost Classifier**), and several other auxiliary analytical techniques.
